AUTOMATIC PUBLISHING OF ISSUES/ARTICLES

- publish article at a certain date/time
- unpublish article at a certain date/time
- publish issue at a certain date/time
        * should the issue articles be published automatically too?
        * if yes, do you want to be able to select articles to be published
        together with the issue? - YES
- unpublish issue at a certain date/time
        * should the issue articles be unpublished automatically too? - YES
- publish/unpublish articles/issues periodically; the user has the following
options:
        * time of day (daily)
        * day of the week (weekly)
        * day of the month (monthly)
        * day of the year (yearly)

Note:
- new articles can not be automatically published; they must be submitted first

- unpublishing an article set it to submitted state
FINE FOR NOW, BUT COULD YOU KEEP IN MIND THAT WE WILL HAVE n NUMBER OF
STATUSES FOR ARTICLES IN FUTURE RELEASES. I COULD FORESEE SOMEONE USING A
"SCRAP" STATUS FOR AUTOMATICALLY UNPUBLISHED ARTICLES, for example.

i think one should have an option:
pressing "publish issue" would take you to the question "publish all issue
articles? yes/no"

TABLES

- add "IdSchedule int(10) unsigned NOT NULL" to AutoId

When creating a new record in IssueSchedule or ArticleSchedule the script will
read the IdSchedule from the AutoId table, increment it and set the Id of the
new record to IdSchedule value.

- IssueSchedule
Id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, (references AutoId.IsSchedule)
IdPublication int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, (references Publications.Id)
NrIssue int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, (references Issues.Number)
Type enum { 'single_action', 'recurring' } NOT NULL,
ActionStart datetime NOT NULL,
PublishArticles enum { 'none', 'selected', 'all' } NOT NULL

- ArticleSchedule
Id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, (references AutoId.IsSchedule)
NrArticle int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, (references Articles.Number)
Type enum { 'single_action', 'recurring' } NOT NULL,
ActionStart datetime NOT NULL

- SingleScheduleData
IdSchedule int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, (references AutoId.IsSchedule)
Action enum { 'publish', 'unpublish' } NOT NULL

- RecurringScheduleData
IdSchedule int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, (references AutoId.IsSchedule)
Action enum { 'publish', 'unpublish' } NOT NULL
Months int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
Days int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
Hours int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
Minutes int(10) unsigned NOT NULL
