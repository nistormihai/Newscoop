PREPARATION - applications you need to have installed
  see the manual page at:

INSTALLATION - the usual procedure

1. Unzip and Untar the campsite file. This will generate a
   folder named 'campsite'.

2. Change into the 'campsite' directory.

   IMPORTANT: If you have an old version of campsite and want to drop
   the old database type: "mysqladmin -u root drop campsite". The
   installer will NOT install a new blank database over the old one.
   If you want to upgrade campsite and keep the old database, continue
   with the next step. The installation will not delete the old database.

3. Type ./install.sh

   If you are not already logged in as root the installer will prompt
   you for the root password when necessary. Without root access it
   can not install the CAMPSITE application.

   IMPORTANT!!!
   If your MySQL configuration is not the default one you'll have to run
   the create instance script separately, after installation. Read
   instructions from install script.

   GENTOO
   You will need to follow these special instructions at:
   http://code.campware.org/manuals/campsite/2.7/index.php?id=152

4. Configure the default instance

   - Edit the file "campsite-vhost.conf" from the instance configuration
   directory (/usr/local/campsite/etc/campsite) and replace $SERVER_NAME
   with the appropriate value. Your system administrator should provide the
   server address and server name. The server name must also be registered in
   the DNS (Domain Name Service).

   - Include the file "campsite-vhost.conf" in the main apache configuration
   file.

   - Restart the apache server:
      killall httpd
      {PATH}/httpd
   or
      /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart

Be aware that the Campsite installer does its best to pick reasonable
defaults in the configuration of the various modules, but that these should
always be checked by the user. (This applies when installing Campsite on
any architecture). You can change all necessary variables interactively in
the installer.

INSTALLATION of multiple instances

You can create new instances without reinstalling Campsite. Just run:

/usr/local/campsite/bin/campsite-create-instance --db_name [instance_name]

- Edit the file "[instance_name]-vhost.conf" from the instance configuration
directory (/usr/local/campsite/etc/[instance_name]) and replace $SERVER_NAME
with the appropriate value. Your system administrator should provide the
server address and server name. The server name must also be registered in
the DNS (Domain Name Service).

- Include the file "[instance_name]-vhost.conf" in the main apache
configuration file.

- Stop the apache server, kill campsite_server, start apache server.  One
way to do this is as follows:
    apache2ctl stop
    killall campsite_server
    apache2ctl start
