ArticleIndex links KeywordIndex and Article tables. The search engine breaks
articles into words; words are saved in KeywordIndex. Then the search engine
links the word(s) to a certain article by means of ArticleIndex:

IdKeyword <------> NrArticle, IdLanguage

Searching for articles containing a keyword:

select ai.* from KeywordIndex as ki, ArticleIndex as ai where ki.Keyword =
    'word' and ki.id = ai.IdKeyword

The only fields that matter in ArticleIndex are IdLanguage, IdKeyword,
NrArticle. All other fields can be discarded and I thought of doing so at
some time but then I realised that I could search in a certain
publication/issue/section by joining only 2 tables (KeywordIndex and
ArticleIndex) compared to 3 tables if IdPublication, NrIssue and NrSection
fields were missing. They are redundant but they also speed up the search
query.
