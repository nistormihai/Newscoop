Article Import Installation Instructions
----------------------------------------

ZZipLib needs to be installed.  You can get it here:
http://zziplib.sourceforge.net/
./configure; make; make install;

XSLT libraries:
Sablotron: http://www.gingerall.com
Expat: http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat

Then you need to recompile Apache & PHP.
First do this:
export LDFLAGS=-lstdc++

"Make sure you follow the advice of adding -lstdc++ to EXTRA_LD_FLAGS in Makefile after you've run ./configure, and BEFORE you've run make (if you issue make, you'll need to do a make clean before you make again, after changing the Makefile, or it still won't work reliably)."

Apache configure command (must be rebuilt after the export command above):
configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache-1.3 --enable-module=so

PHP configure command:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/php-4.3.4 --with-mysql --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache-1.3/bin/apxs --with-zip --enable-xslt --with-xslt-sablot
