PREPARATION - applications you need to have installed

   (Most of the following should be installed with the default
   distribution. But check for MySQL and Apache ...)

1. make
   Usually the make binary is located in /usr/bin directory.
   On rpm systems make package should be installed.

2. stat
   Stat is a utility for displaying the file or filesystem status.
   It is located in /bin directory. On RedHat, Suse stat package
   must be installed. On Mandrake fileutils package must be installed.

3. g++ compiler
   Usually the g++ binary is located in /usr/bin directory.
   On rpm systems gcc-c++ package should be installed.

4. MySQL server
   On rpm systems, MySQL, MySQL-shared, MySQL-devel and
   MySQL-client packages should be installed.
   Check that mysqld daemon is started:
      type "ps ax | grep mysqld".
   You should see one safe_mysqld process and at least
   three mysqld processes. If not, the mysqld daemon is not
   started. Start it typing safe_mysqld as root.

5. Apache server
   On rpm systems, apache or http packages should be installed.
   Configure the Web server (see INSTALLATION 3.) and (re)start
   the httpd daemon.

6. PHP
   Campsite requires PHP 4.3 or newer; the following PHP modules
   must be installed: php-cli (command line), php-mysql, php-gd.

7. Cron daemon
   Usually the crond binary is located in /usr/sbin directory.
   On rpm systems vixie-cron package should be installed.
   Make sure the crond daemon is started:
      type "ps ax|grep cron"
   You should see a cron process.

INSTALLATION - the usual procedure

1. Unzip and Untar the campsite file. This will generate a
   folder named 'campsite'.

2. Change into the 'campsite' directory.

   IMPORTANT: If you have an old version of campsite and want to drop
   the old database type: "mysqladmin -u root drop campsite". The
   installer will NOT install a new blank database over the old one.
   If you want to upgrade campsite and keep the old database, continue
   with the next step. The installation will not delete the old database.

3. Type ./install.sh

   If you are not already logged in as root the installer will prompt
   you for the root password when necessary. Without root access it
   can not install the CAMPSITE application.

   IMPORTANT!!!
   If your MySQL configuration is not the default one you'll have to run
   the create instance script separately, after installation. Read
   instructions from install script.

4. Configure the default instance

   - Edit the file "campsite-vhost.conf" from the instance configuration
   directory (/usr/local/campsite/etc/campsite) and replace $SERVER_NAME
   with the appropriate value. Your system administrator should provide the
   server address and server name. The server name must also be registered in
   the DNS (Domain Name Service).

   - Include the file "campsite-vhost.conf" in the main apache configuration
   file.

   - Restart the apache server:
      killall httpd
      {PATH}/httpd
   or
      /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart

Be aware that the Campsite installer does its best to pick reasonable
defaults in the configuration of the various modules, but that these should
always be checked by the user. (This applies when installing Campsite on
any architecture). You can change all necessary variables interactively in
the installer.

INSTALLATION of multiple instances

Since 2.2.0 a new instance can be created without reinstalling Campsite. Just
run:

/usr/local/campsite/bin/campsite-create-instance --db_name [instance_name]

- Edit the file "[instance_name]-vhost.conf" from the instance configuration
directory (/usr/local/campsite/etc/[instance_name]) and replace $SERVER_NAME
with the appropriate value. Your system administrator should provide the
server address and server name. The server name must also be registered in
the DNS (Domain Name Service).

- Include the file "[instance_name]-vhost.conf" in the main apache
configuration file.

- Restart the apache server:
	killall httpd
	{PATH}/httpd
or
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart
