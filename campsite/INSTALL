PREPARATION - applications you need to have installed

   (Most of the following should be installed with the default
   distribution. But check for MySQL and Apache ...)

1. make
   Usually the make binary is located in /usr/bin directory.
   On rpm systems make package should be installed.

2. m4 macro tool
   Usually the m4 binary is located in /usr/bin directory.
   On rpm systems m4 package should be installed.

3. g++ compiler
   Usually the g++ binary is located in /usr/bin directory.
   On rpm systems gcc-c++ package should be installed.

4. MySQL server
   On rpm systems, MySQL, MySQL-shared, MySQL-devel and
   MySQL-client packages should be installed.
   Check that mysqld daemon is started:
      type "ps ax | grep mysqld".
   You should see one safe_mysqld process and at least
   three mysqld processes. If not, the mysqld daemon is not
   started. Start it typing safe_mysqld as root.

5. Apache server
   On rpm systems, apache or http packages should be installed.
   Configure the Web server (see INSTALLATION 3.) and (re)start
   the httpd daemon.

6. Cron daemon
   Usually the crond binary is located in /usr/sbin directory.
   On rpm systems vixie-cron package should be installed.
   Make sure the crond daemon is started:
      type "ps ax|grep crond"
   You should see a crond process.

INSTALLATION - the usual procedure

1. Unzip and Untar the campsite file. This will generate a
   folder named 'campsite'.

2. Configure the Web server
   The configuration file of Apache is usually called httpd.conf and
   found in the /etc/httpd/conf/ folder. You need to:

   - activate the DirectoryIndex directive and add the following:
        index.xql /priv/templates/idx.xql
   - activate the IndexIgnore directive and set it to
        IndexIgnore *
   - add the following lines:
      AddHandler xql_handler .xql
      Action xql_handler /cgi-bin/www-sql
      AddHandler tpl_handler .tpl
      Action tpl_handler /cgi-bin/tpl_cgi
   - check that web server User/Group correspond to HTTP_USER/HTTP_GROUP
   variables in Makefile; if not modify Makefile accordingly

   [Make sure the server has the rights to read, write and execute the
   folders and files used. Usually, user and group should be set to
   'apache', the rights should be set as 'rwx' for the user and 'rw'
   for the group. Furthermore, the Web server should have the UniqueID
   option activated (the mod_unique_id should be loaded, simply un-comment
   the LoadModule and AddModule lines)]

3. Restart the httpd daemon. Try one of the three otpions:
   a) killall httpd
      {PATH}/httpd                           ...or...
   b) /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart         ...or...
   c) kill -HUP `cat /var/run/httpd.pid`

   [IMPORTANT: your httpd daemon might have a different name.
   The standard apache installation might use apachectl.]

4. Change into the 'campsite' directory.

   IMPORTANT: If you have an old version of campsite and want to drop
   the old database type: "mysqladmin -u root drop campsite". The
   installer will NOT install a new blank database over the old one.
   If you want to upgrade campsite and keep the old database, continue
   with the next step. The installation will not delete the old database.

6. Type ./install

   If you are not already logged in as root the installer will prompt
   you for the root password when necessary. Without root access it
   can not install the CAMPSITE application.

IN DEPTH - example installation

    The following is a possible installation session,
    which would install CAMPSITE on your server.
    All text in square brackets is comment only, not
    to be typed.

localhost$ telnet yourserverIP
Red Hat Linus release 7.0 (Guiness)
Kernel 2.2.16-22 onan i386
login : user
Password: userpwd
Last login...
yourserver$ su -
Password: rootpwd
yourserver# cd my_directory
    [or any other directory where you want to have the
    software sources unpacked]

yourserver# ftp www.campware.org
Connected to www.campware.org
Name (...): anonymous
Password: your@email.com
ftp> cd pub/campsite/source/campsite_V2/
ftp> get campsiteversion.tar.gz
    [change the file name to the one you want to get]
ftp> bye

yourserver# gzip -df campsiteversion.tar.gz
yourserver# tar -xf campsiteversion.tar

    [Now you need to edit the httpd.conf file. Locate the
    file first by typing]
yourserver# updatedb
    [if you haven't generated the database for locating yet]
yourserver# locate httpd.conf

    [Make a backup copy, always a good idea.]
yourserver# cp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.bak
    [the location might vary, depending on your
    configuration and system version]

    [Now open and edit the config file, you can find the
    changes that need to be done further up in this file under
    the section '3. Configure the Web server'. Then you need to
    restart the http daemon:]
yourserver# kill -HUP `cat /var/run/httpd.pid`
    [the `` need to be angled from top left to bottom
    right.]

    [Check if mysql and httpd are running:]
yourserver# ps -A | grep mysql
    [this should return some lines with pid numbers for
    the mysqld. If not, start mysql manually by typing
    'safe-mysql']

yourserver# ps -A | grep httpd
    [this should return some lines with pid numbers for
    the httpd. If not, start httpd manually (see above)]
    yourserver# cd campsite

    [Edit the Makefile according to the folder location of
    the html and cgi-bin file, specified in the httpd.conf
    file (see above). Edit only in the first three lines
    of the Makefile - if necessary at all. Currently it
    should work fine for standard installattions of Red
    Hat 7.0 and Apache.]
yourserver# ./install
yourserver# exit
