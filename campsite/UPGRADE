UPGRADE

The upgrade process from Campsite 2.1.x is semi-automatic; the install script
does not upgrade automatically the existing older Campsite instances. The user
has the choice of upgrading only the instances he/she wants. After finishing
the installation of Campsite 2.2.0 the user must take the following steps to
upgrade an older instance:

a. Run: /usr/local/campsite/bin/create_instance --db_name [instance_name]
where [instance_name] is the name of the instance that must be upgraded.

b. Edit the file "[instance_name]-vhost.conf" from the instance configuration
directory (/usr/local/campsite/etc/[instance_name]) and replace $SERVER_ADDRESS
and $SERVER_NAME with the appropriate values. Your system administrator should
provide the server address and server name. The server name must also be
registered in the DNS (Domain Name Service).

c. Include the file "[instance_name]-vhost.conf" in the main apache
configuration file and remove the old virtual host.

d. Restart the apache server:
	killall httpd
	{PATH}/httpd
or
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart

If you have an older installation of Campsite, either of the 1.x or 2.x
branches, you'll need to upgrade the database and templates first to 2.1.
For this consult Appendix II in the manual.

For more information on the upgrade process read the chapter 1.3. Upgrading
in the manual.
