    /**
     * Starter is a workaround for a bug in some browsers. I some cases the 
     * filling with text and components of the textarea must be delayed 
     * or must be triggered by a user interaction. Otherwise, you get
     * null pointer exception.
     * It shows up a button, by clicking this, the textarea will be filled
     * with the default text.
