INTRODUCTION

Campsite is a robust, stable, and journalist-friendly solution for online
magazines and newspapers that speaks your language.  

Campsite follows the print-newspaper publishing paradigm, so it structures
sites by default as Publications > Issues > Sections > Articles. 

Campsite is available in: English, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Russian, 
Arabic, Chinese, Serbian (Cyrillic), Serbo-Croatian (Latin), Croatian,
Czech, and Romanian.  However, the interface can easily be localized to new 
languages using its built-in 'Localizer'.

CAMPSITE offers...
 - Support for managing articles translated into different languages
 - An advanced WYSIWYG interface for article editing
 - Support for incorporating images into your articles
 - Support for attaching files to articles 
 - Categorizing your articles with topics
 - Scheduling articles for release in the future
 - Full control over the look of your web site
 - Fine-grained access control for different types of staff users: 
   journalist, editor, designer, etc
 - Built-in subscription system with:
   - time trials
   - pay periods
   - IP access control for group subscriptions
 - Support for localizing the interface to new languages
 - An object-oriented API for building plugins or alternative interfaces
 
We encourage further development of this software and would like to make any
progress accessible to all other users. Please contact us if you have or intend
to developed this software further.
