INTRODUCTION

Campsite is a robust, stable, and journalist-friendly solution for online
magazines and newspapers that speaks your language.  

Campsite follows the print-newspaper publishing paradigm, so it structures
sites by default as Publications > Issues > Sections > Articles. 

Campsite is available in: English, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Russian, 
Arabic, Chinese, Serbian (Cyrillic), Serbo-Croatian (Latin), Croatian,
Czech, and Romanian.  However, the interface can easily be localized to new 
languages using its built-in 'Localizer'.

With Campsite you can:

   1. Manage articles translated into different languages
   2. Edit articles using an advanced WYSIWYG interface
   3. Create your own types of articles. In other words, you can create 
      your own definition of what an article is.  For example, one article 
      type might consist of "Intro", "Body", and "References", while another 
      type might be "Body" and "Author Bio".
   4. Incorporate images into your articles
   5. Attach files to articles
   6. Categorize your articles with topics
   7. Schedule articles for release in the future
   8. Require a copy-flow process to ensure quality of content: the
      journalist writes the article, the editor reviews and edits the content,
      and then the article is published.
   9. Have full control over the look of your web site
  10. Exercise fine-grained access control for different types of staff users,
      for example: journalist, editor, designer, etc.
  11. Manage subscribers and allow:
         1. time trials
         2. pay periods
         3. IP access control for group subscriptions
  12. Localize the interface to new languages
  13. Build third-party plugins using the PHP object-oriented API 
  
We encourage further development of this software and would like to make any
progress accessible to all other users. Please contact us if you have or intend
to developed this software further.
