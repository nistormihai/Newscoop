INTRODUCTION

CAMPSITE is a content management system with multi-lingual Unicode support,
designed for medium to large sized online publications. Issues, back archives,
as well as subscription management are fully implemented features. At the core
of management system sits the article editor allowing contributors and editors

knowledge is necessary for formatting text.
