  Major Improvements
  ------------------

  more flexibility, easier development, plugin architecture, fewer
  dependecies and easy install.

2.6.0 "Joey" (July 10, 2006)
  For full details about these changes, see:
  http://code.campware.org/projects/campsite/query?milestone=2.6.0

  Major New Features
  ------------------
  - Frontend users can post comments on articles & comments can be
    moderated by the staff.
  - 'Article Types' screen re-engineered with the ability to rename
    article types, to translate them, to hide or show them, and merge
    them together. Article Type Fields can be renamed, translated,
    hidden, and can change types.
  - Improved security for the login screen.  The password is encrypted
    when it is sent to the server, and if too many unsuccessful login
    attempts are made, a CAPTCHA (an image with text inside) is
    displayed. This prevents automated scripting attacks trying to
    guess passwords.
  - Improved responses to user interaction.  The system now displays
    which action the user just performed and gives a detailed
    explaination if a particular action cannot be performed.
  - If an error occurs in the admin interface, an automated bug reporter
    takes over and allows the user to submit the bug back to the
    Campsite team automatically.  This takes away any extra effort on
    the part of the users to submit a bug and will allow quick
    resolution of anything that comes up.
  - Staff users can submit feedback directly to the Campsite team from
    within the interface.
  - Improved backup/restore scripts: you can now transfer your site
    to another server using these scripts.  Backup file are now tagged
    with the date and time of the backup.  Lots of help
    documentation has been added as well as detailed status messages
    during execution.

  Minor Features
  --------------
  - A 'Save and Close' button has been added to the bottom of the
    'Article Edit' screen
  - Improved layout of the Article Edit screen - more compact, more
    obvious switching between the "Edit/View" modes, and the time the
    article was saved is displayed.  The article number has been added,
    as well as a link to the frontend page.
  - When an article is locked, you are given the option to view it
    without unlocking it.

    screen

    these are sometimes needed when creating a template file.

    for time values.
  - #2034: Added ability to set topic by ID and show topic ID
  - #2071: Implemented "List Images" statement
  - #2007: Template EDIT statements can now have arbitrary HTML added
    to them
  - #1828: Added ability to set "Language OFF"
  - #1713: Added URL statement, equivalent of:
    <!** print publication site><!** uri>

    character (")

    publication/issue/section hierarchy.

    (previously we had the ability to copy, but not move).

    information and an increasing number of views of the workflow.
    It now displays publication/issue/section for all articles, and
    there is a new section to show articles which have not yet been
    placed in a publication/issue/section.
