  Minor Features
  --------------

    any number of its translations, as well as give each translation
    a new name.

    and/or section do not exist in the translation language, you now have
    the ability to create them at the same time you create the article
    translation.

    now remembered.

  - Subscribers list can be sorted by full name, account name and
    creation date.
