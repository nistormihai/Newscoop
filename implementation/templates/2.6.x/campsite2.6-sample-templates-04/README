HOWTO Install the a Campsite Demo Site
--------------------------------------

Install this demo site after CAMPSITE 2.5 is successfully installed.

Steps:

1. Unzip the file (type: tar xzf package_name.tar.gz)
2. Change to package directory (type: cd package_directory)


Express Install
---------------
If you installed Campsite to the default directories and with the default 
instance, use this sequence of commands to install the demo site.  
Otherwise, skip to the "Custom Install" section.

For the following steps, replace [MYSQL_USER] with the database user, 
[MYSQL_PASSWORD] with the database password (-p[password] can be dropped 
altogether if the password was empty), [APACHE_USER] and [APACHE_GROUP]
with the user/group under which apache is running.

3. mysqladmin -u[MYSQL_USER] -p[MYSQL_PASSWORD] drop campsite
4. mysqladmin -u[MYSQL_USER] -p[MYSQL_PASSWORD] create campsite
5. mysql -u[MYSQL_USER] -p[MYSQL_PASSWORD] campsite < campsite-db.sql
(Now login as root or execute the following with "sudo".)
6. cp -fr look/* /usr/local/campsite/www/campsite/html/look
7. cp -fr images/* /usr/local/campsite/www/campsite/html/images
8. chown -R [APACHE_USER]:[APACHE_GROUP] /usr/local/campsite/www/campsite/html
9. Login to the Campsite Administration (go to http://your_site_name/admin,
   username is "admin", pasword is "admn00").  In the main menu click on 
   Content->Publications->Configure.  Change the default site alias to be 
   your web site name.
10. Please restart the template engine: go into the admin interface, 
menu -> Actions -> Restart the template engine.

DATABASE
For the following steps, replace [MYSQL_USER] with the database user, 
[MYSQL_PASSWORD] with the database password (-p[password] can be dropped 
altogether if the password was empty), [CAMPSITE_DB] with the campsite database 
name you selected at install time.

Defaults:
[MYSQL_USER]: root
[MYSQL_PASSWORD]: blank password (dont specify the "-p" option)
[CAMPSITE_DB]: campsite

3. Type: mysqladmin -u[MYSQL_USER] -p[MYSQL_PASSWORD] drop [CAMPSITE_DB]
   This will drop the old campsite database.
4. Type: mysqladmin -u[MYSQL_USER] -p[MYSQL_PASSWORD] create [CAMPSITE_DB]
   This will create an empty database.
5. Type: mysql -u[MYSQL_USER] -p[MYSQL_PASSWORD] [CAMPSITE_DB] < campsite-db.sql


TEMPLATES AND IMAGES
For the following steps, you must login as root or put the "sudo" command
in front of each line.  Replace [DOCUMENT_ROOT] with the document 
root directory, replace [APACHE_USER] and [APACHE_GROUP] with the 
user/group under which apache is running.

Defaults:
[DOCUMENT_ROOT]: /usr/local/campsite/www/campsite/html
[APACHE_USER]: apache
[APACHE_GROUP]: apache

6. Copy the "look" directory into the 
   [DOCUMENT_ROOT]/look directory:
   Type: cp -fr look/* [DOCUMENT_ROOT]/look
7. Copy all of the images in the "images" directory into the 
   [DOCUMENT_ROOT] directory:
   Type: cp -fr images/* [DOCUMENT_ROOT]/images
